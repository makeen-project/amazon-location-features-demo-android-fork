# Amazon Location Services

This repository contains code for an Android application that demonstrates how to use [Amazon Location Services](https://aws.amazon.com/location/). The app showcases features like [displaying maps](https://aws.amazon.com/location/features/#Maps), searching for [points of interest](https://aws.amazon.com/location/features/#Places), calculating [routes](https://aws.amazon.com/location/features/#Routes), [geocoding](https://aws.amazon.com/location/features/#Places), [device tracking](https://aws.amazon.com/location/features/#Trackers), and creating [geofences](https://aws.amazon.com/location/features/#Geofences).

To use this code, you'll need an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) and resources to be deployed within your account. This is automated using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), and this readme explains the full setup process.

Once configured, you can build and run the app locally or execute automated tests. The project includes unit and end-to-end UI tests.

The app supports the following map styles: `Standard`, `Monochrome`, `Hybrid` and `Satellite`

Overall, this repo will help you get started with location-based features on Android using Amazon Location Services.

Please refer to the [AWS Geospatial repository](https://github.com/aws-geospatial/) for other demo apps, including [iOS](https://github.com/aws-geospatial/amazon-location-features-demo-ios), [React](https://github.com/aws-geospatial/amazon-location-samples-react), and [web](https://github.com/aws-geospatial/amazon-location-features-demo-web), as well as additional resources.

## Requirements

Below are the requirements for development, running and testing.

#### Development Tools

1. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Java 11 or above.

#### Pre-requisites
1. [Create your AWS Account](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account) if needed, or sign in to your existing [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
2. Run the [AWS CloudFormation template](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create?stackName=amazon-location-default-unauth-resources&templateURL=https://amazon-location-demo-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/default-unauth-resources-template.yaml) or use the template from `/extra/default-unauth-resources-template.yaml` to create a CloudFormation stack on AWS in the `us-east-1` region and get `IdentityPoolId`, `PinPointAppId`, `WebSocketUrl` from the stack's "outputs" tab.
    - `IdentityPoolId` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `DEFAULT_IDENTITY_POOL_ID`.
    - `PinPointAppId` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `ANALYTICS_APP_ID`.
    - `WebSocketUrl` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `SIMULATION_WEB_SOCKET_URL`.
    - Take region from IdentityPoolId (Character before ':') that value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `DEFAULT_REGION`.
3. Run the [AWS CloudFormation template](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks/create?stackName=amazon-location-default-unauth-resources&templateURL=https://amazon-location-demo-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/default-unauth-resources-template.yaml) or use the template from `/extra/default-unauth-resources-template.yaml` to create a cloudformation stack on AWS in `eu-west-1` region and get `IdentityPoolId`, `WebSocketUrl` from stack output's tab.
    - `IdentityPoolId` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `DEFAULT_IDENTITY_POOL_ID_EU`.
    - `WebSocketUrl` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `SIMULATION_WEB_SOCKET_URL_EU`.
4. After adding all above details in `custom.properties` file in Android studio then open `Build -> Clean project` after this run project.
5. Run the [AWS CloudFormation template](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create?stackName=amazon-location-resources-setup&templateURL=https://amazon-location-resources-setup.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/main-cf-template.yaml) or use the template from `/extra/main-cf-template.yaml` using your own AWS account and get below data.
    - `IdentityPoolId` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `IDENTITY_POOL_ID`.
    - `UserDomain` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `USER_DOMAIN`.
    - `UserPoolClientId` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID`.
    - `UserPoolId` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `USER_POOL_ID`.
    - `WebSocketUrl` value will be added to `custom.properties` file against `WEB_SOCKET_URL`.

Follow this [Document](https://location.aws.com/demo/help) for detailed info to create & configure a new AWS CloudFormation template.

The required values can be found from the `Outputs` tab on your stack page created in step 2, 3, 4 and 5 above.

## Run Locally

To run the application locally, use either an [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) or a physical device connected with [USB debugging enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#Enable-debugging).

    1. Clone the project.
    2. Open the project in Android Studio.
    3. Select 'Run Configuration' as 'app' if not already selected.
    4. Click on run button.

## Running Tests

To run tests locally remember to add the values in `secrets.properties` mentioned above in configure section.

### Unit Tests

UnitTests are configured to run with [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/) and can be executed using various commands having different uses as below:

| Command                                         | Use                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest                     | Runs unit tests without JaCoCo coverage report.                                                                 |
| ./gradlew testDebugUnitTestCoverage             | Runs unit tests with JaCoCo coverage report.                                                                    |
| ./gradlew testDebugUnitTestCoverageVerification | Runs unit tests with JaCoCo code coverage report and verifies if minimum code coverage constraint is satisfied. |

The code coverage report can be found at the following path:

    app_root_dir/app/build/reports/jacoco/testDebugUnitTestCoverage


### E2E Tests

E2E tests can be executed by the following gradle commands. Test suites are configured to cover all the functionalities:

``` 
Note: 
    1. Start the emulator before executing the commands.
    2. If working on windows(Powershell/cmd) wrap the argument in double quotes.
        eg: ./gradlew app:connectedDebugAndroidTest "-Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.aws.amazonlocation.ui.MapLoadAndPlaceSearchFlowSuite"
```


     ./gradlew app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -i -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.aws.amazonlocation.ui.MapLoadAndPlaceSearchFlowSuite
     ./gradlew app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -i -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.aws.amazonlocation.ui.SearchDirectionFlowSuite
     ./gradlew app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -i -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.aws.amazonlocation.ui.MapStylesSettingAndExplorerFlowSuite
